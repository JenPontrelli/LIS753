            <h1 id="article-title">Thousands of gently used books and materials are waiting to be discovered!</h1>
              <p class="article-info">Come support your local library and browse our collection of over 50,000 gently used books, records, videos, magazines and more for sale at bargain prices starting at 50 cents. Admission is based on a first-come-first-served basis. Due to increasing popularity and limited space, a ticketing system will be used for the Main Room sale. Patrons who are in line prior to the 11am opening time will be given a ticket with a time of entry for the main room, allowing for browsing in other rooms without losing your spot in line! Entry will be limited to just 160 customers at a time to prevent crowding and risks to health and safety. Customers are limited to purchasing 12 items per entry, but are welcome to join back in line as time and capacity allows. </p>
              <p class="article-info">Gift certificates may be purchased in $5 denominations. Donations can be brought to the Main Room.</p>
